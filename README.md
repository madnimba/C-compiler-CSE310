This repository contains implementation of a compiler for a subset of language C. These works have been done as assignments for the sessional course CSE310 of CSE, BUET.

Language used:
1. C++
2. Lex
3. Yacc

Each offline has been an increment to the previous one. Offline 4 - Intermediate code generation contains the final compiler for the subset of C.

Features Included:

1. Generates runnable assembly file in final step of intermediate code generation.
2. Detects syntactic errors and creates an error report
3. Gives warning about errors
4. Builds a parsetree
5. Generates log-file for better understanding

You can take inspirations from the code implementation. Exact copying of the code is discouraged.
